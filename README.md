# Hey there! <img src="https://github.com/jekuer/jekuer/blob/main/hello.webp?raw=true" width="29">

I am a tech founder, full-stack developer by heart, marketing expert by education, technical product/program/engineering manager by day, and a lot of other things in between. 

In 2000, at the age of 12, I've started coding and never let go. 
Since I did not study Computer Science, but rather Business Administration, my work is always focused on getting things done from a project's point of view. ðŸ¤“ðŸš€
