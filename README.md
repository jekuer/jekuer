# Hey there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px">

I am a [former tech founder](https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/my-full-movie-like-founder-story-without-the-happy-end-6f50ae5ecf9f), a full-stack developer by heart, technical product manager by day, and a lot of other things in between. 

In 2000, at the age of 12, I've started coding and never let go. 
Since I did not study Computer Science, but rather Business Administration, my work is always focused on getting things done from a project's point of view. ðŸ¤“ðŸš€
